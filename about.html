								<h3>Where I'm going</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/Cousino_Corey.jpg" alt=""/></span> I love solving problems. Software Engineering has a unique case of creating solutions to accomodate and satify global demand. Over the course of the past decade, enterprises have seen a wild shift from hosted datacenters to scalable cloud solutions. Most technologies that have become commonplace in infrastructure did not exist at the beginning of my career. Companies need flexible and adaptable engineers that grasp software-driven solutions and implement them on a platform wide level. I am one of those engineers.</p>

								<p>I am interested in leadership roles that drive a company's five year roadmap. I want to look at your problem and say "If we do this, your entire software delivery will be less expensive and require less maintenance, but will also be more stable, portable, and scalable". Through my decade plus experience in software design and implementation, I know the tools to succeed and preserve strategic advantages for the future to come. </p>

								<h4>How I got here</h4>
								<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Corey3.jpg" alt=""/></span> A graduate of Michigan Technological University, I started programming as a freshman with no prior experience. I quickly learned the inner workings of object oriented languages and applied myself in student organizations; One of those was Husky Game Development. In a few years, I was elected President of Husky Game Development. Under my leadership, we began development of what would become HGD's first commercially released game to Xbox Live Arcade, Arcane Brawlers.</p>
								<p>My first software engineering position was for Sentry Insurance, a mutual insurance company specializing in business insurance based in Stevens Point, WI. Although not your traditional tech company, Sentry needed software engineers such as myself to streamline the business process and reduce overhead. I took this opportunity to learn infrastructure of large scale businesses, and what it is required to meet the data needs of a global enterprise. My first exposure to agile development was fostered here, and I never looked back. Eventually, I received an opportunity to move across the nation and work for a major fortune 500 company: Intel.</p>
								<p>Working for Intel was a real "baptism by fire" moment for me. Never have I been around a more experienced and knowledgeable group of engineers. This company was on the bleeding edge of technology, utilizing software and architectures years before they were popularized. This includes our product's maiden transition from on-premise to a hybrid cloud architecture, one which took years of growing pains and many more prototypes to solve the issues that come with it: big data, key-value data stores, RESTful design, devOps, and containerization. During my tenure at Intel, I also made the personal investment to further my education and pursue an Executive MBA at the University of Oregon.</p>
								<p>Most recently, I am the lead software engineer with General Dynamics Mission Systems, a defense contractor company based in Massachusetts.</p>
